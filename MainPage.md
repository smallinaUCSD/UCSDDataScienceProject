Hi! My name is Seshu Mallina and I am currently a sophomore at UCSD pursuing a degree in Biology with specialiation in Bioinformatics with a minor in Computer Science. I joined this team to learn more about data science and its applications on a biological domian. I think data science is important as one can take existing data and use mathematical and computaional techniques to understand and make predictions. One fun fact about me is that I played on the Warriors basketball court.
