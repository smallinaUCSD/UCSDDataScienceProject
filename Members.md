Hi! My name is Seshu Mallina and I am currently a sophomore at UCSD pursuing a degree in Biology with specialiation in Bioinformatics with a minor in Computer Science. I joined this team to learn more about data science and its applications on a biological domian. I think data science is important as one can take existing data and use mathematical and computational techniques to understand and make predictions. One fun fact about me is that I like the Brooklyn Nets.

Hello! I am Charvi Shukla, and I am majoring in Math-Computer Science at UC San Diego. I joined this team to gain experience in applying skills from Math and CS into the data science domain. Data Science is not only important in revealing hidden patterns from large data, but it is also a very important application of Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy drawing portraits of my friends!
