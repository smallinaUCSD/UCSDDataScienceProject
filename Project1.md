# Project 1: Diabetes Prediction 

In this project our goal was to answer this question: **"Can you build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not?"**

# Dataset:

# Background Information 

# Variables Definition 
1. Pregnancies: Number of times patient was pregnant
2. Glucose: Concentration of glucose after 2 hours [Used an oral glucose tolerance test]
3. Blood Pressure: Diastolic Blood Pressure **(mmHg)**
4. Skin Thickness: Skinfold thickness in triceps **(mm)**
5. Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin **(mmU/mL)**
6. BMI: Body Mass Index calculated using the formula **(weight(kg)/ (height(m)^2))**
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function: Function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
8. Age: How old they are **Years** 
9. Outcome: Boolean value **0 or 1**
